WALRUS' NAV SYSTEM FOR CODENAME FLANKER Su-30
- initial simple implementation of an Inertial Navigation System (INS), necessarily generic for want of hard data
- the features of the INS implemented initially will be basic:
    - three simple gyroscopes, measuring pitch, yaw and roll
    - three simple accelerometers, measuring velocity changes in the x (forward-aft), y (up-down) and z (left-right)
    - its position may be updated via satellite (GLONASS/GPS)
